Welcome to Alex's Page!
===================


This is my first in-class project using **JavaScript**. It involves a simple shopping cart and total calculation.

Documents
-------------

At the moment, the project involves a .js file,  .html file,  and a readme.md. Pretty simple. Let's see where things go. **Woo!**

The program
------------
Within the shopping cart, there are some items that match up in a practical manner, and one item that is pretty wonky in name, and especially price. The **JavaScript** functions have been written to work around such errors, and alert them to the user.

Item             | Value | Quantity
--------        |   ---    |----
Apple Pie       | 3.14     | 1
Auto Cat Feeder | 69.99    |1
70.89           | meow      |1
